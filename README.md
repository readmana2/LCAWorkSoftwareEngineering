# LCAWorkSoftwareEngineering

The main attempt at the problem is in the Java Implementation found in JavaWork/src/
The attempt at a new Programming language is found in PythonProjectWork/

You can find the DAG class in JavaWork/src/ in the main branch
Unit testing for DAG is in DAGTest.java

First Part of the Assignment
For the Java Implementation, I decided to use a Binary Search Tree Class I used in a previous module since I already had experience working with that code base and navigating the constructed Binary Tree. So the first commit for that will have a lot of code added. After that it is just me committing small amount of codes and mainly focusing on the unit testing as well as making minor edits to the Binary Tree class.

For the Python Implementation, I didnt think I would be able to construct a Binary tree in the same way I did with java so I found several online resources showing how one might solve a LCA problem in Python and used them as a reference as the lecturer said we could.


I did both the LCA implementations before the lecturer told us to do Unit testing.
I did unit testing for both implementations but the java unit testing is more detailed and where I focused my efforts as that is the language I was focusing on.


Second Part of the Assignment
I couldnt use the Binary tree to find the LCA of a directed acyclic graph so I started a new class called DAG to use to start again with the problem.
I branched into a branch called DAG and then eventually merged back into main.
