# LCAWorkSoftwareEngineering
Java Project Work contains the java files to run a LCA program.To run the code you will need to either import it into an IDE that auto compiles and runs it such as Eclipse or
to compile it in command line with javac BST.java and then run it with the command java BST.

The python implementation of the code is a lot more basic than the java and is found in the folder with the words Python in it.
